# Installation

## Installing Godot Engine

The GDScript track is built on top of [Godot Engine][godot-engine], which runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android.
This track requires Godot version 4.0 or greater.

After completing the installation, you can verify if the CLI was installed successfully by running this command in a terminal:

```bash
godot --version
```

## Using an IDE

For syntax checking of GDScript files from, for example, [Visual Studio Code][vscode], you'll need to keep the Godot GUI running with a project open in order to activate the debug server, and an extension like [godot-tools][godot-tools] installed and activated.

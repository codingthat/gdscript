## Installing the Exercism GDScript track test runner

You'll need [Godot installed][installation] correctly to use the test runner.

To build and test GDScript scripts for Exercism, Godot will be run in "headless" mode from the CLI.
These instructions currently require Linux and bash.

### Step 1: Installing the overall test runner infrastructure

To set up for testing, clone [https://github.com/exercism/gdscript-test-runner][gdscript-test-runner] and move its contents to `/opt/exercism/gdscript/test-runner/`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/exercism/gdscript-test-runner.git
sudo mkdir -p /opt/exercism/gdscript/
sudo mv gdscript-test-runner/ /opt/exercism/gdscript/test-runner/
```

### Step 2: Downloading the single-exercise test runner script

Assuming you have the `exercism` tool set up and have downloaded at least one GDScript exercise, it should have created an `exercism/gdscript` folder to house the exercises.
Save [the test runner][test-local-gdscript-solution] in this folder and mark the file executable, or just create a link to it:

```sh
cd ~/exercism/gdscript # replace with your exercism/gdscript directory
ln /opt/exercism/gdscript/test-runner/bin/test-local-gdscript-solution.sh
```

## Running tests

With the installation steps done, you should be able start from any exercise directory (e.g., `~/exercism/gdscript/two-fer`) and run the script (living one level up, in `../`) to test your local solution to that exercise:

```sh
../test-local-gdscript-solution.sh
```

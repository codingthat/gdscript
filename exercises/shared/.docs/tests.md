# Tests

## Running tests

With the [installation steps][test-installation-steps] done, you should be able start from any exercise directory (e.g., `~/exercism/gdscript/two-fer`) and run the script (living one level up, in `../`) to test your local solution to that exercise:

```sh
../test-local-gdscript-solution.sh
```

## Solving an exercise

Solving an exercise means making all its tests pass.

To help you get started, each exercise comes with a GDScript file named after the exercise (e.g., `exercism/gdscript/two-fer/two_fer.gd`).
You can use this file as a starting point for building your solution.
Feel free to change it as needed, but the tests expect the function names to be as originally provided.
